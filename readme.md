# Implementation for UAV Path Planning Using on-Board Ultrasound Transducer Arrays and Edge Support

This repo covers and replicates the methodology introduced in the paper. 

A quick overview of implementation and concepts from the paper:

> UAVs that utilizes Ultrasonic transducer arrays to get flight data can sometimes miss or under represent information.
>
> To try and address this a Generative Adversarial Neural Network (GAN) was used to extending incoming data. 
>
> The system in total would be hosted on an network edge node to facilitate fast computations and low latency. 


The proposed solution includes the performance of the simple predictors accuracy based on the fragmented dataset along with the GAN extended dataset. 

The files found in this repo demonstrate the GANs ability to extended data, as well as demonstrate future work that was addressed after publishing the paper.
